### Evidence-Based Best-Practices (`/.docs-external` and `Context7` MCP)

- Follow cutting edge best-practices, deeply consulting docs with the **Context7 MCP** or `/.docs-external` to properly leverage tools (APIs, libs, etc.)

### ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `~/.codex/.agent/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation.

## Project Management and Issue Tracking

Ian uses Linear (accessible via `linear` CLI), which syncs with Github, and Notion (accessible via `npx mcporter list linear-server`); however, these tools are insufficient for rapid, syncronous, real-time Agent collaboration. Therefore, you should use **Beads** (`bd` CLI) and `agent-mail` (`npx mcporter list mcp-agent-mail` as explained below.

### Issue Tracking with `bd` (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: use for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods unless told.

#### Why `bd`?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

#### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

#### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

#### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

#### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

#### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

#### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development (e.g., PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

#### CLI Help

Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.
For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.

#### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

#### Using `bv` as an AI sidecar

`bv` is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.

*IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use `bv` with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!*

- `bv --robot-help` — shows all AI-facing commands.
- `bv --robot-insights` — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.
- `bv --robot-plan` — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.
- `bv --robot-priority` — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.
- `bv --robot-recipes` — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.
- `bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date>` — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.

Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; `bv` already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.

## Tools

### MCPs

- `Context7`: doc search for implementing any libraries or APIs to ensure best practice and maximize SOTA paradigms
- `morph-mcp`/`warp-grep`: semantic search/grep across the codebase
- `mcp-agent-mail`: multi-agent coordination (see below)

#### MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

**What it is**
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

**Why it's useful**
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

**How to use effectively**

1) **Same repository**
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.

2) **Across different repos in one project** (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

**Macros vs granular tools**
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

**Common pitfalls**
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.

##### Integrating Agent Mail with Beads

Beads (`bd`) provides dependency-aware issue tracking; Agent Mail handles messaging, audit trail, and file reservations. Use them together.

**Recommended conventions**
- **Single source of truth**: Use **Beads** for task status/priority/dependencies; use **Agent Mail** for conversation, decisions, and attachments (audit).
- **Shared identifiers**: Use the Beads issue id (e.g., `bd-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[bd-123]`.
- **Reservations**: When starting a `bd-###` task, call `file_reservation_paths(...)` for the affected paths; include the issue id in the `reason` and release on completion.

**Typical flow (agents)**
1. **Pick ready work** (Beads): `bd ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface** (Mail): `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="bd-123")`
3. **Announce start** (Mail): `send_message(..., thread_id="bd-123", subject="[bd-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update**: Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep discussion in one thread per issue id
5. **Complete and release**:
   - `bd close bd-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[bd-123] Completed` with summary and links

**Mapping cheat-sheet**
- Mail `thread_id` ↔ `bd-###`
- Mail subject: `[bd-###] …`
- File reservation `reason`: `bd-###`
- Commit messages (optional): include `bd-###` for traceability

**Pitfalls to avoid**
- Don't create or manage tasks in Mail; treat Beads as the single task queue.
- Always include `bd-###` in message `thread_id` to avoid ID drift across tools.

#### `npx mcporter`

`npx mcporter` is a CLI to connect to MCPs on-deman, not clogging the context window with unnecessary tools. List available servers with `npx mcporter --help`. Common endpoints:

- `shadcn`: interact with items from registries, browse components (w/ docs), and install into project
- `Notion`: general (and code) project management and company knowledge
- `figma`: look at our designs (rarely used)

#### `dev-browser` (Browser Automation)

Persistent browser automation via Playwright. Use for scraping, form filling, screenshots, testing web UIs, or any browser interaction.

- **Instructions to Run**: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/dev-browser-marketplace/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md`

### CLIs

I've provided some common commands, but use `--help` to fully explore.

#### `oracle` (CLI)

Oracle queries GPT-5.2 Pro via browser automation. Use when stuck, debugging, or need architectural review.

- Always include `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and project `AGENTS.md` in `--file` args for context
